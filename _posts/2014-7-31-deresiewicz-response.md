title: Response to Deresiewicz’s “Don’t Send Your Kid to the Ivy League”
---

William Deresiewicz apparently struck a collective nerve recently with his provocative New Republic piece
["Don't Send Your Kid to the Ivy League"](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118747/ivy-league-schools-are-overrated-send-your-kids-elsewhere).
Judging from the my Facebook feed, it seems anybody who's anybody has both read and developed a strong opinion about it. The obligatory wave
of strongly-worded responses has also proliferated over the last few days, some achieving more popularity (at least in my own social circles)
than the original.[^1]

[^1]: In general, I try to avoid articles that capture this much attention. My head-in-the-sand tactic is perhaps an unhealthy one, but I have found that it functions well as a protective mechanism against getting in heated discussions with people I barely know. But that's not my primary motivation for avoiding such articles. I generally find them disappointing and not especially insightful (far beyond what their popularity would suggest), and in turn I find myself disappointed that others have been swept into a frenzy by ideas that don't strike me as especially novel.

Before I respond, I'll briefly say that I was initially hesitant to add my voice to the
already cocophonous network of responses. I ultimately decided to weigh in for one simple reason: I haven't seen anyone challenge Deresciewicz's
article on grounds much more sophisticated than 'that wasn't *my* experience!' There is certainly a place for anecdote, but I think that
his claims are much bigger than individual experiences.

For the uninitiated, Deresiewicz's piece sketches out, as the title suggests, his reasons that the Ivy League is a ruinous intitution for students
and for society at large. For individual students, attending an Ivy League increases your chances of appearing well-adjusted on the outside, yet
being at root a hopelessly lost, insecure, and intellectually conservative "entitled little shit," inexperienced in the art of failure and fundamentally
self-absorbed and superficial. (Feeling surprised it was such a controversial piece?) The mindless but brainy Ivy League drones find their way into
jobs like finance and consulting because they dont't know what else to do to achieve success. He moves on to argue that the Ivy League as an institution
perpetuates social inequality by recreating class structure, and that the solution is a well-funded public system of higher education.
(Not even charitably a unique argument).

Leaving aside innumerable personal anecdotes that fall perpendicular to his assessment, my biggest problem with the article is that it appears to
mistake the cause for the effect. I argue that the Ivy League doesn't create these "entitled little shits," nor does it, itself, fuel inequality.
Rather, the appearance of both of these is symptomatic of a larger, more social issue.

I begin with two premises:

1.   Inequality (that is, the bimodification of the income spectrum) is both real and growing.
2.   Parents want for their children at least the success (if not greater success) than they themselves have enjoyed. 'Success' in this sense is
almost always cast in terms of presige and income.

Neither of these is especially controversial. Now let's look at what happens if we run with them. We get a situation in which entering the upper-rungs
of society is harder and harder, yet parents are continually seeking for their children to achieve that level of success. Towards this goal, parents have
to spend more and more resources on their children (a preparation arms race, if you will), and the children begin to internalize the mantra of academic
achievement. Yes, it looks quite similar to the type of achievement whoring Deresiewicz describes, but it has nothing to do with attending an Ivy League
college.

That is to say, if Ivy League students are drones, they show up that way.

One piece of evidence comes from Shamus Khan's *Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St.
Paul's School*. In it, he argues that a defining characteristic of the New Elite (as he calls the adolescent offspring of the America upper class) is the import they place on hard work. Unlike the elite
of earlier America, the New Elite realize that coming from wealthy lineage is not enough to get them to the top--they must pair it with hard work and unwavering
success. Clearly, the mindset Deresiewicz describes among Ivy League students appears long before they set foot in Cambridge.

A second piece of evidence comes from the surprising but heartening persistence of the liberal arts as fields of study. A quick glance at the 
[official Columbia statistics](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/opir/abstract/opir_ccug_degrees_by_program_1.htm) is all the evidence you need. English, Dr. Deresiewicz's
own subject, is the third most popular major in Columbia College in the 2012/2013 graduating class (more recent statistics are unavailable). 
Yet I imagine a disproportionate number of those students end up in the professions he bemoans.[^2]
It's not, even he would have to concede, because they are not self-critical, nor that they did not explore what they wanted. They got the liberal arts education
he wants for every student, yet it did not have the effect he hoped it would. This is clearly not a case of maladjusted individuals, but a maladjusted society.

[^2]: Sadly, this is currently unverifiable to the general public, as the [results of the graduating student survey from that year](http://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/sites/cce/files/2013_gss--cc__seas-ug.pdf) are only available in a cursory way. For all of our sakes, though, I really hope someone somewhere is doing that analysis, otherwise it is a waste of some excellent data.

To be sure, a lot of his points stand, and I agree with a great many of them. Public education is important, and the American post-secondary educational system 
is especially inexcusable. Ivy League schools do perpetuate inequality by making it possible for only a select few parents to provide the resources (monetary and otherwise) 
their children need to gain admittence. Liberal arts education is of fundamental importance. But that Ivy League schools create drones, rather than harbor them,
is a less tenable argument, in my mind.

As an aside, when I spoke with my girlfriend about the article, she was most interested by the idea that universities have incentives (in the form of alumni donations) to get students
into finance, consulting, and the like. I agree that it is an interesting point. One thing I have been thinking about recently, though, is the extent
to which institutions can have goals. An institution as heterogenous as a university has a fascinating array of goals at every level--from the office of the president
to the guy who scans your books at the library. The way that they come together to form one institutional goal is fascinating. My current thinking is that, at least in
a university, it is very difficult (read: essentially impossible) for the entire institution to align behind certain goals. In fact, although the institution as a whole
might share an incentive to boost alumni donations, the Offices of Admissions and Career Services are unlikely to share that goal, and as such, nothing much comes of it. But I think
it is a point worth thinking about.
