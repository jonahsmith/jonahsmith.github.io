title: IKEA assembly tips
---

About two months ago, my girlfriend and I moved out of the Columbia dorms and into an apartment together. In the weeks leading up to the move, we had excitedly picked out all of the furniture we wanted in our new home, which, naturally, were all from IKEA. 

A few days following our official move-in date (but before we moved in for good), we received our IKEA delivery.[^1] After we actually moved in, we were (or, perhaps a little more accurately, *I* was) faced with the daunting task of putting together an entire apartment's worth of furniture. While I struggled over the next few days to summon the patience and strength to finish, I took notes to reference if I ever face the situation again. I am posting them in the hopes that it will help someone else, as well.

[^1]: By the way, I highly recommend the IKEA delivery service. It's hard to find any information on it, but it is a flat-rate fee to get all of your stuff sent to your place, regardless of how much stuff there is (although the fee is tiered depending on your distance from the IKEA). This is distinct from the service that allows you to give them a list of items you would like and they will collect them from the showroom and send them to you. Although the delivery arrived much later than our delivery window, it was incredibly convenient, and would be even moreso if you live in a walk up.

## Things I'm glad I did

### Get a white rubber mallet
I was skeptical that it would be worth it, but at the suggestion of a blogger (whom I now unfortunately cannot find but wish I could cite), I got a white rubber mallet from Home Depot. It was crazy useful. There are many times the instructions suggest you apply some force, and sometimes a lot. While some suggest covering a hammer with a sock or cloth and using that, I am hesitant--a hammer can do serious damage if you mess up. If you're assemblying a lot of furniture, it is worth the five dollar investment. And if not, find a friend who already has one! (I'm a good place to start.)

(By the way, it's white so that it doesn't leave skid marks on the furniture.)

### Cover the floor with an unfitted sheet
Trust me--a fitted sheet is a no-go. Luckily, because we were moving from dorm rooms, where the twin XL (who came up with that size?) reigns, we had plenty of extra sheets that were up to the task. Uncovering them from our luggage and boxes, though, was not easy. Some anticipation of this issue before we packed would have gone a long way.

Anyway, covering the floor is the big point here. We are fortunate enough to have nice hardwood floors, and we were definitely nervous about scuffing them. Covering them added peace-of-mind. (IKEA recommends covering the floor as well, but so that their furniture doesn't crack when you turn it over or move it. Go figure.)

### Have a full toolkit ready to go
As a teenager, I was the designated assembly-man of any new furniture that entered our family home. There are no IKEAs in Rochester, so the furniture we bought was always of the same spirit ('assemble these particle-board pieces yourself'), but not actually IKEA brand. These often came with the tools you needed to assemble them.

IKEA furniture very rarely comes with tools. Occasionally you'll encounter an odd hex-key or something that they will provide, but you're on your own with screwdrivers, the aforementioned mallet, and the like. So do yourself a favor and have a reasonably well-stocked toolkit ready. A few different sized Phillips-head screwdrivers, a hammer, and a mallet should suffice, but be prepared. Having a toolkit is probably an important thing to have around the house, also, so consider it a small investment in homeowning if you already have one.

### Put something under your knees
Building a bunch of IKEA furniture will bring you to your knees. Literally. And it starts to hurt. If you spend several hours a day on your knees on a hardwood floor, you're gonna have a bad time. It's worth putting something--anything, use your judgement and creativity--under your knees. I used everything from fur to extra styrofoam and cardboard from the containers. Have it ready and start early, too. Preventative care is the best kind of care.

### Go through all of the instructions before starting
This is the most theoretical advice I can offer. Take 5-10 minutes before you start to go through all of the steps. Imagine how the pieces go together and how you will approach each step. Make sure you understand everything and how each part contributes to the bigger picture. Develop an intuition.

There are tons of reasons that this is really important. First, it will save you time as you build. Second, it will prevent you from messing up because you didn't understand how a piece would become part of the larger piece of furniture. Having an intuition will enormously reduce your chances of messing up. Third, it helps you avoid being blindsided by needing an obscure tool or another person to help while you're alone. Fourth, it is an opportunity to rest your body between pieces of furniture. I'm sure the list is longer, but you get the idea

### Go slowly and be meticulous
This is basically my life philosophy anyway, but it nevertheless applies to assembling IKEA furniture. I inherited from my dad a belief in the proverb 'haste makes waste.' It will probably save you both money and mental energy to work slowly and methodically. It doesn't have to be a tortuous process.

### Assemble storage furniture first
We were caught in a bind. We had possessions almost completely obscuring the floors of our apartment. We couldn't put them anywhere because we didn't have anywhere to put them away. But because we couldn't clear any floor space, we couldn't assemble anything.

We were eventually able to clear about 25 square feet to assemble everything. The first thing I assembled were the chests of drawers. This allowed us to put our clothes away, which gave us more space to work with. Getting the clutter out of the way will certainly help your state of mind, and it will pay big dividends in helping you put together more of your furniture.

## Things I wish I had done

### Check all of the boxes ASAP
We discovered too late that our bookcase didn't survive the delivery here. One of the side panels was snapped in half when it arrived. IKEA is pretty good about providing replacement parts in situations like this, but only if you discover within 48 hours. By the time we discovered, it was too late. If you inquire to IKEA by phone, they will consider sending you the part after the window closes, but they can decide they do not want to deliver it (apparently it's up to the discretion of the manager of the store). We had absolutely no way of getting to and from IKEA with a 6 foot tall plank of wood that would have cost less than the $80 it would have cost to buy a brand new one. So bye bye Billy.

### Get something for [knolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoll_(verb)) (and do it!)
Okay, I realize I'm not using the word 'knoll' quite right, but it's the best way to explain the concept I'm getting at. Laying out all of the screws, brackets, and other miscellaneous parts *before* you start working would be tremendously helpful. It will speed up the process, it's meditative, and it helps you make sure you're not about to start a project for which there aren't enough screws.

Unfortunately I don't have much advice on what to use for this. If you have small bowls or tupperware containers, that would work great, I imagine. A bait-and-tackle interior would also be great. In any case, I wish I had taken the time to do this.

### Electric screwdriver 
This is apparently a controversial suggestion in the IKEA community (oh yes, there's an IKEA community). The fear is that you can strip the screws or the particle board if you overtighten. I would definitely not recommend a drill for this reason, but if you have a low-torque screwdriver it could save a lot of time.

### Take breaks
I am very bad about taking breaks from tasks, which is something I've been working on. Once I start a task, I have a lot of trouble stopping before I'm done. But sometimes you need it, especially for tasks that are both mentally and physically strenuous like assembling IKEA furniture. So take on every once in a while.

So, there you have it! Assembling IKEA furniture can be a stressful and strenuous task, especially when you have a lot, but with the right strategy you will be enjoying your apartment in no time.
