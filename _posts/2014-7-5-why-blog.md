title: Why blog?
---

As a general character trait, I am pretty reserved, and this is no less true online. My [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/jonah.smith) lies basically fallow, except the occasional meta post (it just feels wrong to post articles about Facebook on Twitter). My [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jonahesmith) account is admittedly somewhat active, but I rest easy knowing that very few people actually read it. And that's about it for my social media presence.[^1] 

[^1]: Creating a G+ profile seemed like a great idea three years ago, but it too lies dormant. At this point, I check it only very occasionally for [Linus Torvalds posts](https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts).

Given all of this, it might be a bit unexpected that I am going to start blogging. Truth told, it's something I've thought about for a while now. There are three main reasons I decided to go for it.

## Personal website
As I set up my personal website, it soon became clear that I have very little content to host. While it's not really a waste of resources--it is hosted for free via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I bought the domain names long ago just to have them in my pocket--it does seem as though I have to somehow justify having a personal website to begin with. I would be lying if I said having the website were not a big part of my reason for starting a blog.

## A file for reflections
On an admittedly less superficial note, my decision to start blogging was partly inspired by the thoughts expressed by the famed sociologist C. Wright Mills in _The Sociological Imagination_.[^2] Writing long before web blogs existed, he argued social scientists should keep a file of their thoughts and reflections, and that doing so is important for both personal and professional development. In addition to inviting the important habit of writing, it allows people to reflect on how their lives and work intersect, to guide people towards clearer thought, and avoid repetitious work. Sounds good to me.

[^2]: Tangentially, I am proud to have been affiliated with [the same sociology department](http://sociology.columbia.edu/) where he taught for many years.

The extension of this idea to the modern world is not especially clear. [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/about), explaining his own blogging intentions, takes for granted that, had C. Wright Mills written in the age of blogs, he would undoubtedly have thought blogs fit the bill. It's [not an uncommon argument](http://sociologicalimagination.org/archives/10208). But the idea that such a file, which is quite personal both in its conception and its content, should be public, is not necessarily an obvious one to me.

## Thinking out loud
This objection was largely silenced for me by an excellent [Wired article](http://www.wired.com/2013/09/how-successful-networks-nurture-good-ideas-2/all/) by Clive Thompson I read last week.[^3] Thompson argues that we are in the process of transforming ourselves into a civilization of voracious writers. In doing so, we have become clearer thinkers and, perhaps more importantly, changed the dynamics of how we spread ideas. It can be a matter of one person being exposed to one idea to have a big impact. Check out the article if you have any doubts.

[^3]: No judgements--I'm about 10 months behind on my Wired subscription.

I have no illusions of grandeur. I highly doubt anything awesome will happen as a result of a few words I push to GitHub. But I hope that someday, someone will happen upon a post and find something useful, interesting, or meaningful. Perhaps not such modest ambitions after all.
