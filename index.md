I am an interactive technologist based in New York City. I am primarily interested in the narrative and expressive capacity of data, algorithms, and computation, especially as they interact with the physical world.

I am a front-end developer at The New York Times, where I work on projects to help readers better understand and navigate the news. Previously, I led the technology team at MoMath, the National Museum of Mathematics. I have masterâ€™s degrees in computer science and journalism from Columbia University, and undergraduate degrees in statistics and sociology, also from Columbia.
