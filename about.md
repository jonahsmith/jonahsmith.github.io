title: About
---

I am an interactive technologist based in New York City. I am primarily interested in the narrative and expressive capacity of data, algorithms, and computation, especially as they interact with the physical world.

I currently lead technology at MoMath, the National Museum of Mathematics. Previously, I was an intern on the interactive news desk at *The New York Times*. I have master's degrees in computer science and journalism from Columbia University, and undergraduate degrees in statistics and sociology, also from Columbia.
